    "The goal of our project is to understand basketball teams that make it to the championships. What elements do these teams have in common? Do they have a specific strategy, a similar winning pattern, or the same types of players? Or, are these teams making it to the championships based on random factors/factors that cannot be quantitatively measured? We start off with cleaning our data to be more easily readable, and then we do some exploratory data analysis to better understand trends within the games. Next, we will analyze what factors (if any) are common between the teams that end up at the champsionships. Finally, we will try to use these factors to predict what teams will win the championships."
